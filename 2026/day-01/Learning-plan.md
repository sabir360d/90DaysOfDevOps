# 90 Days of DevOps – Learning Plan

## Understanding of DevOps & Cloud Engineering
DevOps is a **culture, mindset & set of practices** that enables faster, reliable software delivery through automation, collaboration, and shared ownership between development and operations.
Cloud Engineering provides **scalable, on-demand infrastructure** that supports modern application deployment, monitoring, and resilience.
Together, DevOps and Cloud emphasize automation, continuous delivery, observability, and end-to-end system ownership.

## Why I Am Learning DevOps & Cloud
I am pursuing DevOps and Cloud to:
- Upskill for **career growth and role elevation**
- Build strong hands-on expertise in **Linux, CI/CD, containers, and cloud**
- Understand **how systems work end-to-end**, not just individual tools
- Move into a modern, high-impact engineering role

Linux is a key focus because most production workloads run on Linux, making it foundational for DevOps and SRE roles.

## 90-Day Goals
By the end of 90 days, I will:
1. Deploy a **containerized application on AWS** using Docker and Kubernetes  
2. Build a **production-ready CI/CD pipeline** using GitHub Actions  
3. Troubleshoot **Linux, Docker, and Kubernetes issues** with confidence  

## Core Skills to Build
- Linux & system troubleshooting  
- CI/CD automation (Git, GitHub Actions)  
- Containers & Kubernetes fundamentals  

## Time Management
- **Weekdays:** 2-2.5 hours/day  
- **Weekends:** 4-6 hours/day  
- **Weekly Total:** Approximately 18-22 hours  

Consistency approach:
- Practice daily, even with small progress
- Focus on discipline over motivation
- Complete assignments, labs, and projects
- Learn in public by sharing progress
